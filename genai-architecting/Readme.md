## Business Requirements
The company wants to invest in owning their infrastructure due to concerns about data privacy and rising costs of managed GenAI services.
The system must support 500 active students.

## Functional Requirements
The system must support Open-Source Large Language Models (LLMs) that can run on the specified hardware investment.
Data storage and access must be provided for AI training materials.

## Non-Functional Requirements
System performance must be optimized for running AI workloads efficiently.
Scalability should be considered for future student growth.

## Risks
Open-source LLMs may not be powerful enough for the required workloads.
Storing and processing copyrighted materials may lead to legal challenges.

## Assumptions
Open-source and free LLMs will be sufficient for the intended AI use cases.
The serverâ€™s internet bandwidth will be enough to serve all 500 students.

## Constraints
The system must operate within the allocated budget.
The infrastructure must comply with data protection regulations.

## Data Strategy
Data collection and preparation must adhere to ethical and legal standards.
Data quality and diversity should be ensured for effective AI model training.

## Model Selection and Development
The system will primarily handle text-to-text processing.
Model performance will be assessed based on latency, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
